# Activity 2: FASTA files and visual alignment with MEGA


## Exploring a fasta file 

**1. Navigate to the folder containing the fasta files. **

```{cat, class.source='foldable'}
$ cd ebio4100/day2/
$ ls 
```

**2. Look at the file. **

```{cat, class.source='foldable'}
$ less chickadee.fasta 
```

**3. How many samples are included in this file?  **

```{cat, class.source='foldable'}
$ grep ">" chickadee.fasta | wc -l 
```
