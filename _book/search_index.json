Taught by Megan Frayer July 2025 0.1 How to use this ebook This text will outline the activities that we will complete each afternoon during our course. Hopefully, this will also remain available on my GitHub page after the class Canvas site goes away. Some extra information you will see in this text: Keep Learning! Boxes like these throughout the book will indicate resources where you can learn more! These resources are not necessary for our course, and will not be part of assignments– they are just for your own learning. Caution! Boxes like these throughout the book will indicate common pitfalls or places where we will make assumptions for simplicity that you should NOT make in real data. 0.2 Goals/Learning Objectives 0.3 How to succeed in this course: Bioinformatic software is always being improved, so it is not important to memorize commands, but to understand the types of data and challenges you will face. This course is meant to give you a starting point for digging deeper into the questions and work that might interest you in the future. 0.4 Important Links CURC On-Demand Portal CURC Documentation CURC Cheatsheet "],["activity-1-computer-set-up-and-introduction-to-the-command-line.html", "Chapter 1 Activity 1: Computer set up and Introduction to the command line 1.1 Get oriented to the cluster 1.2 First command 1.3 How to navigate a file system 1.4 Basic file manipulation 1.5 Assignment 1.6 If we have extra time…", " Chapter 1 Activity 1: Computer set up and Introduction to the command line The first thing we need to do is make sure everyone can log onto the cluster. We will use the cluster for the rest of the activities in this course. 1.1 Get oriented to the cluster The first thing we will need to do is make an account. Everyone will need to set up an account following these instructions. A member of the CU Research Computing staff will be on call to help us this afternoon. Watch this video to learn about the Alpine filesystem. If you would like more information on the cluster, please see the documentation on their website. You can also refer here if you need help during the course! Overall Documentation CURC Cheatsheet 1.2 First command When you have accessed the Apline shell, type `echo “Hello World!”. The argument will be printed below your command. Congratulations, you’ve run your first command! 1.3 How to navigate a file system We will now familiarize ourselves with the file system. [What does the home look like] [Where is the shared folder] 1. List the contents of your home folder. Code ls 2. Make a new folder called Day_1 and switch your location into that folder. Code mkdir day_1 cd day_1 3. What is the file path to this location? Code pwd 4. What are the command options for ls? Code ls --help 1.4 Basic file manipulation 5. Copy the file day1.txt from our shared folder to your day_1 folder. Code cp PATH/day1.txt day_1 6. Rename the file to day_1_original.txt. Code cd day_1 mv day1.txt day_1_original.txt ## or mv day_1/day1.txt day_1/day_1_original.txt 7. Look at the whole file, then at just the first 5 lines, then at just the last 5 lines. Code cd day_1 less day_1_original.txt head -5 day_1_original.txt tail -n5 day_1_original.txt 8. Count the lines of the file that contain the word “apple.” Code wc -l day_1_original.txt grep apple day_1_original.txt &gt; day_1_apples.txt wc -l day_1_apples.txt grep [aA]pple day_1_original.txt | wc -l 1.5 Assignment Write a command that makes a new file from day_1_original.txt that contains the first three lines with the word apple in them. Give the output file the name yourlastname_day1.txt and copy it to the shared folder Assignments/Day1. 1.6 If we have extra time… When running jobs on the cluster, we will typically use scripts. Watch this video from CURC. Make a script in your day_1 folder called count_apples.sh. Fill out the script. Run with with sbatch count_apples.sh. This will give you a job ID. Use that to run sacct -j &lt;job ID&gt;.
